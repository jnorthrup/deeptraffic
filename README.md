# deeptraffic

this project chronicles weeks of exploration leading to a working competitive trainable solution

what became evident was that a 2 layer network, the input, and the output, 5 nuerons, were most expedient to train due to the limitations of the convnetjs hardware performance and memory limitations of browser javascript.  multiple agents reduce the oncoming traffic hazards for cruising ease, but the idea that you can do other than "mash the gas" in order to back out of a jam and to tweak the safety system permissiiveness is a red herring that appears to have mislead myself and others as written.

to the credit of the deep learning community, the experience I have had ramping up on deep neural nets is language agnostic, requiring niether python nor js specific implementation knowledge or documentation.
